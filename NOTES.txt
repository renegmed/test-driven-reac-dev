Types of Data in React

PROPS                               STATE

Is passed from parent to child      Is modified using setState()
  
Is immutable                        Calling setState() triggers re-renderer

                                    State updates may be asynchronous

What should be tested in a React component?
    Test the output
    Test the states 
    Test the events 
    Test the edge cases
